# Recap Project 6: Tourio App

The Tourio App helps you keep track of sights you want to visit by allowing you to add, edit, and delete places. It even comes with a comment section for each place so you can leave notes or share thoughts about your favorite destinations.

This project was part of the neue fische bootcamp and a recap exercise to demonstrate our skills in creating a full-stack app with dynamic CRUD operations, database connections, and deployment.
